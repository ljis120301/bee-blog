            I intend to somewhat use this site as a place for me to rant about things I am currently interest in. I might not always be acuurate in the information I write. I will try to cite my sources as much as possible. Just keep in mind that I am not convey information in a 100% factual manner but rather I will write about things from my current understanding of the subject. If I say something inaccurate or convey information in a way you take offense to, please reach out to me.
